# Assistive-Smart-Cane-HCI

## Overview
Assistive-Smart-Cane-HCI is an assistive technology project designed to enhance accessibility and mobility for visually impaired users. The cane integrates real-time obstacle detection and haptic feedback using an Arduino-based system, helping users move more confidently and independently.

## Project Objective
- Increase mobility safety for visually impaired users
- Provide real-time environmental feedback through vibration
- Minimize cognitive and perceptual load using haptic signals
- Create a lightweight, ergonomic, and modular design

## Key Features
- Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects obstacles within a set range.
- Vibration Motor: Provides immediate feedback to alert the user.
- Arduino Microcontroller: Processes sensor data and controls output.
- Lightweight Design: Battery-powered and easy to carry.
- Error Prevention: Adaptive thresholds to minimize false alarms.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno R3
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Vibration Motor Module
- HCI principles based on Ben Shneidermanâ€™s "Designing the User Interface"

## Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Techniques Applied
- Real-Time Feedback: Immediate vibration upon detecting obstacles.
- Error Prevention: Adaptive sensor thresholds reduce false positives.
- Perceptual Load Minimization: No auditory alerts; only haptic feedback to reduce cognitive strain.
- Universal Usability: Designed for users with various levels of visual impairment.

## Future Improvements
- Conduct usability testing with visually impaired users
- Increase durability through drop and extended-use testing
- Improve modularity for easy sensor upgrades
- Extend battery life beyond 8 hours

## Acknowledgements
This project was developed for a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course, following guidelines from "Designing the User Interface" (Shneiderman & Plaisant) and HCI best practices for accessibility and usability.
